# Programming Styleguide

For this project we will be using [PSR-1][psr1], [PSR-2][psr2] and
[PSR-4][psr4].

Furthermore, the following rules are specified in the `.editorconfig` and should
be followed at all times:

 - Line endings should be Unix line endings (LF)
 - Trailing whitespaces should be removed
 - All files must have a final newline
 - The file charset is UTF-8
 - The files are indented with 4 spaces, no tabs.
 - Lines should be 80 characters at most. This is a MUST for Markdown files.
